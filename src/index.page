# What's Erlware

At our core we host public repositories containing reliable Erlang
OTP-compliant packages. These packages are ready to download and
install for end user purposes or for using as development
dependencies. Erlware is Erlang/OTP developer central.  We are open
source and mostly MIT-licenced.  Essentially Our repositories enable
users to use software written by the Erlang community and to publish
and distribute their own software for use by others.

# Getting Started

**If you are new to Erlware,** look at the [Erlware
section]({relocatable:/erlware})

**To browse applications and releases** in our repositories, go to the

# Quickstart Video

This video is the first in a series of three screencasts that will get
you started with Erlang/OTP programming quickly

**Please Note Mac Users:** there is a small problem with Sinan on mac.
The current version requires you to start the Sinan server manually.
To do this run `sinserv` from the `erlware/bin` directory.
